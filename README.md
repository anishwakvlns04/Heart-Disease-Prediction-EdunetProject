# Heart-Disease-Prediction-EdunetProject
Heart disease is a major global health concern requiring early and accurate diagnosis to prevent serious outcomes. Traditional methods are time-consuming and depend on expert analysis. This project uses machine learning to predict heart disease risk based on medical data, enabling faster and more reliable decision-making.
